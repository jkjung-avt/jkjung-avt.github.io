Recently I started to use Caffe on Jetson TX2/TX1 since it is the deep learning framework best supported by [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt). At the time of this writing, the latest version of TensorRT for TX2/XT1 is TensorRT 2.1, which is included in JetPack-3.1.

Below I documented how I installed Caffe and PyCaffe for python3 on my Jetson TX2. Note that most of the Caffe installation tutorials I found online were using python2.7. I had to modify a few things to make everything working for python3.

Prerequisite:

* Complete installation of JetPack-3.1 on the target Jetson TX2.
* Build and install opencv-3.3.0, and make sure its python3 bindings are working properly. You can reference my [How to Install OpenCV (3.3.0) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/opencv3-on-tx2/) post.

Reference:

* Official Caffe installation instructions: [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)
* Official Caffe tutorial: [http://tutorial.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html](http://tutorial.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)

Installation Steps:

Note that in the following installation steps I omitted OpenCV and CUDA toolkit stuffs since they were already installed by the prerequisites.

```shell
### Install dependencies for Ubuntu (< 17.04), while omitting libopencv-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
$ sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```

Next I'd grab Caffe source code from GitHub and create a Makefile.config for Jetson TX2. Basically I modified the following things from Makefile.config.example.

* Set `USE_CUDNN := 1`
* Set `OPENCV_VERSION := 3`
* Add `compute_62` (for TX2) and `compute_53` (for TX1) into `CUDA_ARCH`
* Replace python2.7 stuffs with python3.5
* Set `WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1`
* Add `/usr/include/hdf5/serial` into `INCLUDE_DIRS`
* Add `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` and `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial` into `LIBRARY_DIRS`

The resulting `Makefile.config` could be downloaded from [here](/assets/2017-08-08-caffe-on-tx2/Makefile.config).

```shell
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
$ cd caffe
$ cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
$ vim Makefile.config   # Modify this file according to the above
$ make -j4 all
$ make -j4 test
### Test and verify the caffe build
$ make runtest
```

The rest of the steps were for python3. Note that I had to upgrade python-dateutil specifically, and I also had to install [leveldb-0.20](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/leveldb) and [matplotlib (2.0.2)](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git) from source to make them work properly. Specifically I referenced this article, [Resolved: Matplotlib figures not showing up or displaying](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/08/24/resolved-matplotlib-figures-not-showing-up-or-displaying/), to fix the problem of matplotlib for python3.


```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
$ sudo pip3 install -r ~/caffe/python/requirements.txt
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade python-dateutil
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p src
$ cd src
### Build and install leveldb-0.20
$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/03/98/1521e7274cfbcc678e9640e242a62cbcd18743f9c5761179da165c940eac/leveldb-0.20.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf leveldb-0.20.tar.gz
$ cd leveldb-0.20
$ python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
### Build and install matplotlib (2.0.2)
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
$ cd matplotlib
$ python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
$ sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev
$ sudo pip3 install pytk
### Final step: modify matplotlibrc (line #38) to use TkAgg as the default backend
$ sudo vim /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc
#
### build pycaffe
cd ~/caffe
make pycaffe
```

Finally, I'd add the following line to `~/.bashrc`.


```
export PYTHONPATH=/home/nvidia/caffe/python
```

At this point, the installation was completed. I'd verify it with:


```shell
$ python3
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> import caffe
```
In addition, I'd also benchmark Caffe performance on Jetson TX2 by: (Set Jetson TX2 to max performance mode with `nvpmodel` and `~/jetson-clocks.sh` beforehand. Reference [link](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1023671/jetson-tx2/low-frame-rate-with-flir-camera-on-tx2-when-using-cudafilters-library-from-opencv/post/5208659/#5208659).)

```shell
$ cd ~/caffe
$ ./build/tools/caffe time --gpu 0 --model ./models/bvlc_alexnet/deploy.prototx
