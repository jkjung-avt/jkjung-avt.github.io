When I started programming with python3 on Jetson TX2, I found that "import cv2" did not work. It appeared that the pre-installed OpenCV4Tegra (2.4.13.1) only provided bindings for python2.7. After some research, I found the recommended solution to this problem was to re-compile OpenCV.

I was kind of reluctant to remove OpenCV4Tegra and re-build OpenCV by myself. But anyway I finally decided to do it. I documented the procedure below.

Prerequisite:

* Complete installation of JetPack-3.1 on the target Jetson TX2.

Reference:

* [Installing OpenCV Guide for Jetson TK1](http://elinux.org/Jetson/Installing_OpenCV)
* [Ubuntu 16.04: How to install OpenCV](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/)

Installation Steps:

Note that opencv_contrib modules (cnn/dnn stuffs) would cause problem on python caffe. After some experiment I decided not to include those modules at all.

```shell
### Remove OpenCV4Tegra
$ sudo apt-get purge libopencv4tegra-python libopencv4tegra-dev libopencv4tegra
$ sudo apt-get purge libopencv4tegra-repo
### Install dependencies based on the Jetson Installing OpenCV Guide
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential make cmake cmake-curses-gui g++ libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libeigen3-dev libglew1.6-dev libgtk2.0-dev
### Install dependencies for gstreamer stuffs
$ sudo apt-get install libdc1394-22-dev libxine2-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
### Install additional dependencies according to the pyimageresearch article
$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev libavcodec-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
### Install dependencies for python3
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install numpy
### Download opencv-3.3.0 and opencv_contrib-3.3.0 source code
$ mkdir -p ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.3.0.zip -O opencv-3.3.0.zip
$ unzip opencv-3.3.0.zip
### Build opencv (if for TX1, set CUDA_ARCH_BIN="5.3" instead)
$ cd opencv-3.3.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
        -D WITH_CUDA=ON -D CUDA_ARCH_BIN="6.2" -D CUDA_ARCH_PTX="" \
        -D WITH_CUBLAS=ON -D ENABLE_FAST_MATH=ON -D CUDA_FAST_MATH=ON \
        -D ENABLE_NEON=ON -D WITH_LIBV4L=ON -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
        -D BUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

To verify the installation:

```shell
$ ls -l /usr/local/lib/pyhton3.5/dist-packages/cv2.*
$ python3
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import cv2
>>> cv2.__version__

```
