NVIDIA formally released [JetPack-3.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) around mid March. I finally got time to update my Jetson TX2 to this latest BSP release and started to play with it.

I tested/verified my previous posts with JetPack-3.2. Overall I only needed to do some minor updates to my installation steps for opencv3. All other stuffs worked the same way as before (JetPack-3.1). More specifically, I've verified (and upated if necessary) the following:

* [How to Install OpenCV (3.4.0) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/opencv3-on-tx2/)
* [How to Install Caffe and PyCaffe on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/caffe-on-tx2/)
* [How to Capture and Display Camera Video with Python on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/tx2-camera-with-python/)
* [How to Capture Camera Video and Do Caffe Inferencing with Python on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/tx2-camera-caffe/)
* [YOLOv2 on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/yolov2/)
* [Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/ssd/)
* [Faster R-CNN on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/faster-rcnn/)
* [YOLOv3 on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/yolov3/)

In addition to the above, I think the most significant update in JetPack-3.2 is the release of **TensorRT 3.0 GA**. Reference: [JetPack Release Notes](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-notes). I shall look into TensorRT 3.0 in the near future. Hopefully I could share some experiences on that soon.

```
TensorRT 3.0 GA
  - Support for TensorFlow models
  - Up to 15% perf/W improvement for DL applications
```
