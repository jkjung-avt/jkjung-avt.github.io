Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is probably the fatest deep-learning-based object detection model today. I tested it on Jetson TX2. It did seem to live up to the claim and perform well on the NVIDIA embedded GPU platform.

To gain an understanding about how SSD works, you can refer to the paper and the GitHub code share by the original author.

* ["SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325v5)
* weiliu89's caffe implementation of SSD: [https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd)

Here's how I installed and tested SSD on Jetson TX2.

Prerequisite:

Note that I've run SSD on Jetson TX2 with **python2** so the descriptions below are all towards **python2**. It looks like the SSD code on GitHub should also work for python3. And I think it is easy to adjust the steps below to use python3.

* Build and install opencv-3.3.0, and make sure its **python2** bindings are working properly. You can reference my [How to Install OpenCV (3.3.0) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/opencv3-on-tx2/) post.
* Install all dependencies required for Caffe. You can refer to my [How to Install Caffe and PyCaffe on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/caffe-on-tx2/) post for details. Just **replace all `pip3` with `pip`, and `pyhton3` with `pyhton`**.

Building the Code:

1. Check out the code from GitHub.

   ```shell
   $ cd ~/project
   $ git clone https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe.git ssd-caffe
   $ cd ssd-caffe
   $ cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
   ### Set TX2 to max performance mode
   $ sudo nvpmodel -m 0
   $ sudo ~/jetson_clocks.sh
   ```

2. Modify Makefile.config as below. Or you could reference my modified [Makefile.config](/assets/2017-11-30-ssd/Makefile.config).

   * Set `USE_CUDNN := 1`
   * Set `OPENCV_VERSION := 3`
   * Add `compute_62` (for TX2) and `compute_53` (for TX1) into `CUDA_ARCH`
   * Replace python2.7 numpy include path with `/usr/local/lib/.....` (since I used `pip install numpy` to install the latest version of numpy)
   * Set `WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1`
   * Add `/usr/include/hdf5/serial` into `INCLUDE_DIRS`
   * Add `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` and `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial` into `LIBRARY_DIRS`

3. Build and test Caffe.

   ```shell
   $ make -j4 all pycaffe
   ### Testing is optional
   $ make -j4 test
   $ make runtest
   ```

Testing:

In order to do testing, you'll first need to downloaded the pre-trained caffemodel (weights).

1. Download the pre-trained "SSD300" caffe model from Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0BzKzrI_SkD1_WVVTSmQxU0dVRzA&export=download](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0BzKzrI_SkD1_WVVTSmQxU0dVRzA&export=download). Then decompress it.

   ```shell
   $ cd ~/project/ssd-caffe
   $ tar xzvf ~/Downloads/models_VGGNet_VOC0712_SSD_300x300.tar.gz
   ```

2. To test the SSD model with a video file as input, you just need to execute the following command. The displayed frame rate was around **8~8.5 fps** when I tested it on my Jetson TX2.

   ```shell
   $ PYTHONPATH=/home/nvidia/project/ssd-caffe/python python ./example/ssd/ssd_pascal_video.py
   ```

3. To test the SSD model with a USB webcam, you'll have to modify 1 line of code in `./example/ssd/ssd_pascal_webcam.py`. More specifically, on line #76 you'd set `webcam_id = 1` (corresponding to /dev/video1). Then execute the following cmomand. The displayed frame rate was around **10 fps** on my Jetson TX2.

   ```shell
   $ PYTHONPATH=/home/nvidia/project/ssd-caffe/python python ./example/ssd/ssd_pascal_webcam.py
   ```
