title: "How to Install Torch7 on Jetson TX1"
excerpt: "This article describes how I install Torch7 on Jetson TX1. Since Torch7 gets updated frequently and its building process on TX1 might break from time to time, I'll try to update this blog to include the latest necessary fixes/workarounds whenever I can."

This article describes how I install Torch7 on Jetson TX1. Note that Tegra X1 is an arm64 (aarch64) platform, which doesn't seem to be natively supported/tested by Torch7 developers. As a result there might be tweaks required when we download Torch7 source package and compile it on Jetson TX1.

Prerequisite:

* Complete installation of [JetPack-2.3.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) (latest version for the time being) on the target Jetson TX1.
* Especially make sure CUDA toolkit (nvcc) is working on the target Jetson TX1.

Reference:

* Official Torch7 installation guide: [http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
* "dusty-nv" maintains a Torch7 build script on GitHub: [jetson-reinforcement/CMakePreBuild.sh](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-reinforcement/blob/master/CMakePreBuild.sh)

Installation Steps:

```shell
 ### Within a terminal, run the following commands
 $ git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
 $ sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
 $ cd ~/torch
 $ vim install-deps
 ### comment out line #194 of 'install-deps' which reads "install_openblas || true"
 $ bash install-deps
 $ ./install.sh
```

Discussion:

* I basically follow the official Torch7 documentation.
* Using the pre-built OpenBLAS package on TX1 could save a lot of compilation time.

To-do:

* Investigation of cutorch.test() and cunn.test() failures/errors, as discussed in [this NVIDIA Developer Forum post](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/937270/jetson-tx1/torch7-on-tx1-/post/4964058/#4964058).
