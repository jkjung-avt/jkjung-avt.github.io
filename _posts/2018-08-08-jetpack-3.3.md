NVIDIA formally released [JetPack-3.3](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1037811/jetson-tx2/jetpack-3-3-mdash-l4t-r28-2-1-release-for-jetson-tx1-tx2/) around end of July. According to the [ReleaseNotes](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-notes), the highlight of this 3.3 release is **TensorRT 4.0 and its corresponding cuDNN libraries.**

I tested/verified most of my previous posts with this JetPack-3.3. And I'm happy to report that all Caffe/TensorFlow models work as expected. More specifically, I've just verified the following on JetPack-3.3:

* [How to Install OpenCV (3.4.0) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/opencv3-on-tx2/) -> I installed **OpenCV 3.4.2** this time around.
* [How to Install Caffe and PyCaffe on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/caffe-on-tx2/)
* [How to Capture and Display Camera Video with Python on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/tx2-camera-with-python/)
* [How to Capture Camera Video and Do Caffe Inferencing with Python on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/tx2-camera-caffe/)
* [Multi-threaded Camera Caffe Inferencing](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/camera-caffe-threaded/)
* [Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/ssd/)
* [YOLOv3 on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/yolov3/)
* [How to Do Real-time Object Detection with SSD on Jetson TX2](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/camera-ssd-threaded/)

I also plan to test out NVIDIA's recently released [TensorFlow/TensorRT Models on Jetson](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Jetson/tf_trt_models) on JetPack-3.3, and post an update soon. So stay tuned.
